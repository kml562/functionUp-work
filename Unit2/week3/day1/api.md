API


API stands for Application Programming Interface, and it's basically a set of rules and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate with each other.
Think of an API like a waiter at a restaurant. Just like a waiter takes your order and communicates it to the kitchen, an API takes requests from one application and sends it to another application, and then sends back a response.
Let's say you're using a weather app on your phone. When you open the app, it sends a request to the weather API to get the current weather data for your location. The API then takes that request, retrieves the weather data from its database, and sends it back to the weather app as a response. The weather app then displays that information to you.


Another example is the Google Maps API. When you use Google Maps to get directions from one location to another, it's actually making requests to the Google Maps API to get the route and directions. The API takes the request, calculates the route based on the requested start and end points, and sends back the directions to the Google Maps app.
APIs are commonly used in many different industries, such as finance, healthcare, and social media. For example, when you use a banking app to check your account balance, the app is communicating with the bank's API to retrieve your account information. Or when you sign in to a website using your Facebook account, the website is using the Facebook API to authenticate your login.
In summary, APIs are a way for different applications to communicate with each other and share information. They're like the middleman that makes it possible for apps to work together seamlessly.
