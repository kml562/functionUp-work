Problem 1:
- Create a folder called ‘assignment’
- Inside ‘assignment’ create 2 folders ‘source’ and ‘destination’
- Inside ‘source’ create a text file using a command ( not manually)
- Add content in the text file
- copy the contents of ‘source’ folder in ‘destination’ using cp command
End result : both the folders source and destination should have the same file
 


Problem 2:
- Remove the above file from ‘destination’ folder
- Move the file from ‘source’ to ‘destination’
End result: Only destination folder should have the file.
