From Now I will give you the notes I made between " ", and you just have to tell me in few lines that I will show you how that what are the main python doncept covered in that file. Write ok if you accept it. Example given below -
Code - 
"
# Output
# print("hello")
# print("hello \n world")
# print("String"+" "+ " hellow")


# input
# name = input("What is your name\n")
# city = input("What your city name\n:") // input always string
# length = len(name + city)
# print("Your band name is : "+name +" "+ city + " rockers");
# better way is fstring f"Your band name is {name} {city} {rocker}"
# print(length)


# Note -> ; is not compalciry
