Mongodb ->

Locally we can connect with mongodb using
mongodb://localhost:27017/

and for atlas -> login to atlas then new project -> connect then choose the network and then enter username password and we will get the connection  url which wed can use to connect.

For compass just copy the compass url and paste it in compass for better GUI

Use coggle or miro for mind map.
