SignUp -> 

1. User will send name, email, password - recive it in req.body ->
2. Write a check - if all fields exist.
Note -> password should be encrypted from the model only.
3. Create the user.
4. Get the JWT token (create it)
5. Send the cookie ->
const options = {
        expires : new Date(Date.now() + 3 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000),
        httpOnly : true,
    }


    res.status(200).cookie('token',token,options).json({
        success : true,
        token,
        user
})




Login ->

1. User will enter email and password - take it and recieve it from req.body
2. find that used in our database, if it don't exist then tell them to register.
3. Then check if password is correct or not -> If not error.
4. provide them token



Logout ->
Note -> JWT tokens are stateless -> If anyone has the token and it is not expire then anyone can login
hence we have to delete it
