Let's see how forget password works ->

Let's say we forget password or we want to change the password then ->

1. We will send a request to server by clicking forget password btn and then we will enter our mail and a mail is been send to us.

2. Now first user is been checked in the database, if the user exist or not, if user not exist then register, else we have a function called tokenGeneration which will create a token, this token contain String(Hash) and expiry date, this token is been send to both database and user(email)

3. Now user will send new password, now in database we will first check if token expire or not, then we will check the token is same (database token === user token) if same then only we will replace the old password with new one
