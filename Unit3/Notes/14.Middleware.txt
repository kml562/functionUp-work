Middleware - Which happens in between of req and res, for example - Authorization.
Next() - A middleware is basically a function which have req, res and next - after the middleware completes we call next to call next middleware or to generate response.

req - Middleware1(Check if user loggedin or not)----Next----Middleware(Wether user is admin or manager)--Next----> Dashboard.

Ex ->

app.get('/loc', (req,res,next)=>{
    ....functinality...

    next()
})

It intercepts with incoming req, do something with it, and pass it to next piece of app

Ex -> we have a middleware which check authentication that user is authN to use this particular route in application or not



*middleware function to check if user is authenticated
const isAuthenticated = (req, res, next) => {
  const token = req.headers.authorization;

  if (!token) {
    return res.status(401).json({ message: 'Authentication token missing' });
  }

  *perform validation on token here

  next(); // pass the request along to the next piece of the application
};

*define a route that requires authentication
app.get('/api/protected', isAuthenticated, (req, res) => {
* this code will only be executed if the user is authenticated
  res.json({ message: 'You are authorized to access this resource' });
});
