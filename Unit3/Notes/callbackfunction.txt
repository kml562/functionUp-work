A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed when the parent 
function is called. In other words, a callback function is a function that is called back by another function.

Callback functions are commonly used in asynchronous programming, where a task may take some time to complete, 
and the program needs to continue executing other code while waiting for the task to finish. In this scenario,
 the callback function is called when the task is complete, allowing the program to continue with the next set of
  instructions.
